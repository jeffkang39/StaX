<p>In my spare time when not working as a software developer, I contribute to a couple open source projects that I am quite proud of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/elmah"" rel=""nofollow"">ELMAH</a> (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide error logging facility that is completely pluggable. </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/managedfusion/managedfusion-rewriter"" rel=""nofollow"">URL Rewriter</a> a .NET module which mimics the Apache mod_rewrite syntax for support in IIS and Casini</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/managedfusion/fluentcassandra"" rel=""nofollow"">Fluent Cassandra</a> a .NET client for accessing the NoSQL Apache Cassandra database.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Oh yeah and I also wrote a book:</p>

<p>I've been using computers since I was 4, which is now more than 30 years. When I think about this it makes me feel old. I love rollercoasters, big band jazz and movies.</p>

<p>I primarily write web software using Ruby on Rails, but recently started writing iPad applications in Objective C. I spent an awful lot of time using Delphi, and now pretty much only maintain things in it.</p>

I end up doing a lot of Compact Framework and WinMobile development, not exactly through choice but just as a result of what people around me are involved with. It's kinda fun in a masochistic fashion, certainly makes you think more about your code (power management and transactionality anyone?)<br><br></p>

<p>I love debate as it helps us get closer to truth (or perhaps just a more in-depth description of lies), I may occasionally come across at somewhat mean online but this is only because you're unable to see the fact that i'm grinning in a playful fashion in reality. :)<br><br></p>

<p>As an aside, I would rather users not edit my comments to remove swearing as it somewhat dilutes and blandifys the actual intent of my communication. I think the more reasonable scenario is for those who are offended to gouge out their own eyes with a rusty spoon.<br><br></p>

<p>I'm a Java developer with exposure to several other languages and platforms including .Net, Ruby/Rails, and Flex.</p>

<p>I've worked on a variety of types of projects ranging from short term individual work to very large scale, multi-phase projects using multiple large development teams.</p>

<p>I've developed both back end message processing systems as well as end user facing webapps.</p>

<p>I most enjoy working on smaller teams with other talented developers in an environment where we are responsible for the entire application stack end to end.</p>

<br/><br/>
I am one of those guys that wanted to make those Atari and Commodore computers on display in K-Mart in the early 80's do something.  I spent way too much time in the 7-11's (and any other arcade) blowing my allowance on Donkey Kong, Galaga and the rest.<br/><br/>That and countless hours playing Zork on my aforementioned Commodore 64 got me hooked on programming, always with a desire to animate things and make really cool graphical stuff.  Somehow I ended up doing factory automation software, enterprise apps and web site integration to legacy back ends.  The closest I get to games is doing XHTML/CSS and pretending I'm a designer.

before 900; Middle English me, Old English mē  (dative and accusative singular); cognate with Dutch mij, Old High German mir</p>

<p>Usage note 
2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

I'm also into physics and astronomy, <a href=""http://last.fm/user/mattkantor"" rel=""nofollow"">music</a>, sociology, philosophy, and just about anything that I think might help me make sense of this crazy and beautiful world. Designing things and solving problems are ways of channeling my creative energy to shape a better future.</p>

<p>I grew up on <a href=""http://schocharieridge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">a rural horse farm</a> in New Tripoli, PA. There still isn't cable on our street, the phone lines were so bad that we were lucky to get a 30K internet connection, and it took 45 minutes to traverse my old school district. We once found moonshine under our floorboards when remodeling a room.</p>

<p>I like fixing things; I enjoy the outdoors; I think that most people take themselves way too seriously. I derive a profound sense of spiritual fulfillment—though I'm not a religious man—from exploring the whys and whats of this world.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most of my professional career has involved web design &amp; development.</p>

<p>I enjoy building modular software with clean yet flexible APIs. When creating web services, I believe in building atop HTTP instead of kludging my way around it: I create RESTful systems that are truly part of the web in both spirit and practice.</p>

<p>I try to use open source software and follow open standards whenever practical.</p>

<p>At home, when I have some spare time, I also like programming. I tried some Nintendo DS programming in Lua, C, and C++. In the process, I learned (basic) OpenGL and wxWidgets on desktop computers, too. I also used Git, GitHub, and Google Project Hosting for personal projects.</p>

<p>Besides programming and computers, I'm a total music (metal/rock) and movie (fantasy/horror/sci-fi) geek. I like going to live gigs, eating in nice restaurants, and travelling to countries I never visited before.</p>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with VBA.<br>
I loathe it as much as I am strangely drawn to it.<br>
It is old but it will not die, it is ugly but equally fascinating.<br>
When I code in VBA, I feel like I discovered an old secret that begs to be understood.<br>
I imagine ways to hack it, to ply its ancient curses into modern idioms.<br>
Then I fail.<br>
Then I try again.</p>

I'm a Delphi developer, going back to Turbo Pascal 5.5, TPW and BP/O7. I do a reasonable amount of SQL Server (mostly schema design, sprocs and T-SQL utilities) and maintain some legacy apps that use Firebird and Interbase.<br>&nbsp;<br>
I've been picking up C# (both .Net and Mono), and more recently WPF, and have some basic utilities written using Mono that run on Windows, Mac and Ubuntu.<br>&nbsp;<br>
I develop bespoke software - I run my <a href=""http://www.robsoft.net"" rel=""nofollow"">own small company</a>, mostly writing point-of-sale systems for the financial services and high-street finance type markets.<br>&nbsp;<br>
In my downtime I explore my Mac (I switched a few years ago, now I do all my work in VMs on the Mac), and I have a 1-year-old daughter who is the other 'apple of my eye'.<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>I then spent 2 amazing years working at Outbrain , a cool start up that changes the way you read on the web (you just don’t even know you've already used it). I then moved to Clearforest - a Thomson Reuters company - where I worked as an NLP software engineer and had the the change to work with leading expert in the NLP world and learn a bunch of new stuff (Whoo!) and algorithms. Finally I've joined the Natural Language Understanding team at Ginger Software, where we've dealt mainly with Speech to text algorithms and infrastructure, and now I'm working on my Thesis. </p>

<p>I’ve always been fascinated by computer science – everything from machine learning algorithms via vision problems to the best way to manage concurrency in Java and debugging log files (which is the real programmers porn ).

<p>As a kid, he wrote programs on a mechanical typewriter, imagining what the computer would do with his BASIC programs. In 1982, he bought his first 8-bit CPU (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_1802"" rel=""nofollow"">RCA 1802</a>) which he programmed in binary, by toggling switches.</p>

<p>In 1984, he discovered the <a href=""http://www.smaky.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">Smaky</a> at the local school and started experimenting with new programming languages, such as PASCAL, LOGO, PROLOG, etc.</p>

<p>On Christmas 1985 he received a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128#Commodore_128D"" rel=""nofollow"">Commodore 128D</a> from his parents, on which he developed his first real applications: a drawing program, followed the next year by a text processor.</p>

<p>In 1991, he wrote his first implementation a LISP interpreter for the Smaky computer. He had already acquired some experience developing system software, applications and drivers in CALM assembly language for the Smaky OS.</p>

<p>A few years later, he gradually switched from assembly language to C++ and contributed a port of GCC and Ghostscript to the Smaky. He also developed the <a href=""http://infini.smaky.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">Smaky emulator</a> and the last Smaky hardware (Smaky 400).</p>

<p>Now, he is still happy developing software, but mainly in C#...</p>

<p>Pierre has a Ph.D. in Computer Science (artificial intelligence) from the <a href=""http://www.epfl.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">EPFL</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Commandments:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Please obfuscate your code making it, at best, unobviously broken. Even if the code isn't important.</li>
<li>Global state has been a known bad idea for forty years. Please don't do.</li>
<li>Corollary of either of the first two commandments: Singletons are pure evil. Don't. </li>
<li>Please think about encapsulate. That implies not shoving getters and setters all over the place. Also prefer not use implementation inheritance and avoid protected. Generally limit unnecessary access and implied implementation, even on larger scales.</li>
<li>Please practice good dependency hygiene. Yeah it's not interesting, but turns out to be really important for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>If you're doing layers of security, please do check each layer individually. </li>
<li>Please don't give nulls a meaning. Throw an NPE.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things that are wrong:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>""Postel's Law"". Good for UI, but for machine interface you wont catch errors and differences fixing mistakes allows TOCTOU-style vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Increasing the number of reviewers decreases the depth each one expends on the problem. It's the maximum depth which is crucial unless the problem is trivial in which case who cares.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities are the adversary's fault. Vulnerabilities are the fault of the party that decided to ship the faulty product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Work:</strong> A ""Vulnerability Engineer"" in the Java SE Security team for Oracle Corporation UK Ltd.</p>

<p><strong>Top advice:</strong> If I were you, I wouldn't be starting from here.</p>

<p><strong>Toast advice:</strong> Look after the corners and the middle will look after itself.</p>

I am a .NET software developer located in New Orleans.  I have been lurking around the ALT.NET community since I have no idea how to actually design a system in early 2008.  Since, I have become a big proponent with in my company for tdd, domain driven design, loose coupling, et al.  My other programming interests are PHP, F# and Python which I am all bad at.
</p>

<p>
My interests outside of work are Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, emergence theory, independent music (mostly post-punk), philosophy, American politics, current science, particle physics, living in New Orleans and learning in general.  Not at all in that order.

In 2011, I moved to Alaska and directed my interest towards Earth Science. My specialty is remote sensing of landscape processes in the circumpolar north, in particular wildfires. I like to use Python when I can, but will work in R, Matlab, NCL, IDL, or on occasion Fortran or C and have written a number of web-based and command-line applications that require tools such as Django, PHP, Perl, shell scripting and SQL, and of course HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I believe science needs to be reproducible and am enthusiastic about the technologies that enable this, in particular iPython notebooks and Sweave in R. Outside science, I am fond of linguistics, i18n, Unicode and all that.</p>

He is involved in developing web, mobile and desktop applications since 1999. In the beginning he learned the basics with Borland Delphi 1.0 and PHP / MySQL and used classic ASP within some jobs. Since 2004 he’s working with C# and ASP.NET (MVC) on .NET 2.0 - 4.0 in addition with MS-SQL, as well as WPF, Silverlight and Windows Phone 7. He is trying to put as much effort into the .NET community as often as he finds some free time.<p></p>

<p>Currently he is employed as a Technology Producer at the DATA MODA digital engineering GmbH in Mainz, a cross-media agency. He passed his education as a Designer of digital and print media specializing in non-print media operations in June 2009 with distinction.

Real name if you want to talk to me is Kevin Woolley, but I've been using Cruachan as a handle since helping to run the #Delphi channel on IRC back in the mid-90's (although it's not a unique moniker unfortunately - possibly because it's such a great mountain to climb).<br>
<p>
25 years IT experience in numerous business sectors.  I've acquired a large cupboard of technologies - from Cobol to Python and OS/360 to iPhone OS with considerable experience as as DBA, Systems Analyst and Project Manager mixed in there too. Obsessive neophile always on the look out for new shiny to play with and still in love with coding - which is why I went Freelance a decade ago so I could make a living doing something I enjoy doing more than anything else. Most recently obsessing over how Python is a really neat language having just completed a medium-sized IronPython project, wondering if I can find any practical excuse to learn Haskell, and finally releasing iPad/iPhone applications (augmented reality!).
<p>
Oh - and still on the look-out for the project that will make me a million :-)</p>

The company strives to be developed around its employees.  No one is pulling out their hair and the company has lots of events to keep moral high.</p>

<p>Info Dirs develops software for telecommunications billing solutions.  I'm learning what this really means everyday.  The create a software portal when one can logon and check their landline/mobile bill, add new features, pay online and more.  We also create the app that creates each user profile, the phone plan, calculate the taxes, manage how to bill when out of network and much much more.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://sqlspacemap.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">SQL Space Map</a> - if you have some large SQL Server databases and you'd like a visual picture of which tables and indexes are taking up that space, it's the tool for you.</li>

<li>always follow strict coding guidelines</li>
<li>always use a good version control system</li>

<blockquote>
""The programmer, who needs clarity, who must talk all day to a machine that demands declarations, hunkers down into a low-grade annoyance. It is here that the stereotype of the programmer, sitting in a dim room, growling from behind Coke cans, has its origins. The disorder of the desk, the floor; the yellow Post-It notes everywhere; the whiteboards covered with scrawl: all this is the outward manifestation of the messiness of human thought. The messiness cannot go into the program; it piles up around the programmer.""

<em>-Ellen Ullman</em>

First computer I owned was a Sinclair ZX-81 on which I progressed to programming Z80 assembler by the time I was 13. I consider programming to be a lifetime learning experience.</p> 

<p>Most of my professional experience has been programming in C and Java primarily in the networking and communications arena.  More recently JavaScript for web and mobile applications enters into the mix. In the early professional years there was Pascal and COBOL and in the 90's a fair amount of iSeries CLP and some RPG. On the markup side of things I have had to learn a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and various dialects of XML, including SOAP (XML) web services.</p>

<p>My programming hobby activities are mostly in Java, but I enjoy dabbling with a variety of procedural, OOP and functional languages and the many hybrids thereof.</p>

<p>Of a personal nature, I am a committed Christian; I guess one would best describe me as ""Evangelical"", though it's tough to find a moniker that works well. I enjoy philosophical and scientific discussions and I am firmly convinced that real, practical Christianity engages the whole person, heart, mind and spirit. Christianity is a faith that involves reason and intellect, an aspect which has been neglected in the 20th century church: ""Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the <strong>renewal of your mind</strong>, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

<p>My first paid coding job turned up when I was thirteen years old.  A neighbor down the street was planning on writing a book on various card games.  My task was to write interactive card playing routines in BASIC to be included as examples in the book.  The book was never published, but I was paid more money in one summer than I probably had rights to.</p>

<p>My first job after college was working on accounting software in Java.  It was just a six month gig, but I met some memorable people and learned many lessons that I rely on to this day.</p>

<p>A few years back, I founded my first company with a couple of partners.  <a href=""http://www.milyli.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Milyli</a> is a Microsoft .NET shop where we customize various document management platforms including SharePoint and we encourage folks to make it like you like it.  It's also the only company I've founded as I still help run the joint.</p>

I started my Oracle odyssey with Oracle 7 and went all the way to Oracle 11, and currently getting excited about Oracle 12. I am a Certified Oracle Professional. My core strength and primary area of interest is development and high performance tuning of UNIX-centric Oracle-based applications. One particular type of environment where my skills make a difference is data warehouses.</p>

<p>Most of my work experience was in financial industry: big banks, stock brokers, superannuation industry. I have an in-depth understanding of ASX share trading systems.</p>

<p>Throughout my career I worked in a number of roles: I was a DBA, a programmer, a 3rd line production support engineer, and a data architect. Although Oracle is my core competence, my professional knowledge and experience are not limited to just Oracle. I began my career programming in C and C++, developed an admiration for those languages, and I still possess very strong C/C++ skills. Back in the days I spent a lot of time programming in Delphi, and I still miss that powerful development environment which was way ahead of its time. I do little bit of programming in .Net, mostly in my own time, and dug through intricacies of enterprise Java code while tracing bugs in my support roles. I also know UNIX Shell, Perl, Python, and starting to get into Ruby.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I am deeply interested in databases other than Oracle. I worked with MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL. I keep my eye on emerging cloud databases, Big Data systems and NoSQL.</p>

<p>I am located in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

Trained in the ancient arts of RPG our Emperor fought many a battle with sys admins and project managers in order to spread the truth of clean, readable design code. Alas, our hero was tragically scarred in the line of battle while fighting with an IT manager that deemed it more important to patch an already failing system by appending an overly complex front end system. While ultimately triumphing in victory our hero gained a new perspective on software design. It was during this period that he turned to the dark side, enslaving those who did his bidding and bringing turmoil to those who stood in his way.</p>

Because it’d take way too long to list everything I’ve dabbled in, I’ll make it short by saying that I like C, Python and JavaScript, dislike C++ and PHP, and used Delphi back in the early 00’s. It’s debatable whether HTML and CSS are programming languages, but I still consider it to be coding — after all, it still involves problem solving.</p>

<p>For a couple of years, I did LAMP web development, and was a small–time WordPress contributor. Later on, I dabbled in Python, and wrote a PyGTK app called <a href=""https://jeremy.visser.name/python-iview/"" rel=""nofollow"">Python-iView</a>. My latest obsession is actually networking (particularly IPv6), and all of the concepts that go with it — whether it’s routing, or dissecting IP packets at the bit level. I consider Wireshark to be just as important as my prescription glasses in my daily life.</p>

<h2>Answers</h2>

<p>When you answer a question, don't just paste your code. Your answers will be much better when you explain why your code is doing what it does and how it achieves the asker's goal. It makes it a whole lot easier to follow along. As it is I am much more inclined to up-vote answers that have explanatory text about what the code is doing and why it is written as it is.</p>

<p><a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answers/8259#8259"">Answers that just contain links aren't likely to get an up-vote from me either</a></p>

<p>If I down-voted your question, it was almost certainly because it wasn't programming related or because it was a ""I don't know anything about X, write my code for me."" <a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Try to educate yourself before asking a question</a>.</p>

<p>If I down-voted your answer, it was because it was either just wrong, or more often, because you failed to read the question. e.g., Q: ""I need a way to share files... I don't think I want Subversion..."" Your answer: ""Use subversion(link)"". Or you just posted the first link from Google, without any explanation. If it was that easy, we wouldn't need to ask the question would we?</p>

I was IdentityMine's European branch's first employee, based in Zurich Switzerland, where I live with my wife Chi Meei and my two daughters Alise and Laeticia.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2008, the book ""Silverlight 2 Unleashed"" that I wrote was published at Sams. This book is a complete tutorial about Silverlight and filled with code samples and illustration in full color. ""Silverlight 4 Unleashed"" (the sequel) is now in preparation and will be published in the second half of 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Originally an Electronics engineer, I achieved a postgrade study in Software Engineering in 1999. In the past, I worked at Siemens from 1996, where I helped introduce WPF and other .NET 3.5 technologies worldwide. My job involved developing with the mentioned technologies, training and coaching my colleagues, coordinating and integrating the graphics designers' work, and relationships with Microsoft. Prior to that, I wrote embedded C/C++, and then moved to desktop computers in Java, JavaScript and eventually .NET (desktop and ASP.NET).</p>\n\n<p>Privately, I code in Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET. I blog on http://blog.galasoft.ch and write on http://www.galasoft.ch where I publish articles, prototypes and demos related to the mentioned technologies. In 2008, I earned a MCTS for WPF. 2010 is my 4th year as a Microsoft MVP (Silverlight) and I was selected in 2010 as Silverlight MVP of the year.</p>\n","1142","37","8","7123","","43"

I am a software developer by trade but like many programmers it is also a hobby.  My first program was written on a Commodore 64.  In college I wrote C++, Fortran and a touch of Pascal.  
</p>

<p>
I started my professional career doing web development before the bubble using ASP, PERL, Java and SQL.  Over the years I have spent a lot of time programming for the web and the desktop.
</p>

<p>Today I specialize in the Microsoft development stack.  I currently utilize C#, SQL Server, ASP.Net, ASP.Net MVC, Silverlight, Javascript/CSS/HTML/jQuery.  I also have recent experience with WPF/XAML, WCF, Silverlight, NUnit and WinForms.
</p>

<p>
Besides my Microsoft work life I use Mac at home and play with Cocoa, Ruby on Rails and MySQL.  I enjoy travel and baseball.  My wife and I have added the two hobbies together, and have seen games at 8 MLB parks, 1 spring training park and 3 minor league parks.

<p>Ceramic collector, obsessive cook, entrepreneur and professional geek.</p>

<p>I was doing a one-person consultancy for a couple of years, doing some Rails stuff, some .Net services work, and some work in Groovy/Java for a pharmaceutical firm called Dendreon. When that project wrapped up, I took a Rails-focused job at a hybrid Ruby/C# shop, Getty Images.</p>

<p>I'm interested in functional languages like Scala and F# but have relatively limited real-world experience with them.</p>

<p>In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Revenue Science (now Audience Science), Zillow, a travel company called Virtuoso, the Seattle Times, and a very strange financial/transportation conglomerate.</p>

<p>My long term professional ambition is to find a way to work from Tokyo/Kawasaki/Yokohama either 100%, via frequent travel, or remote work opportunities. If you're interested in tracking down a reasonably competent Rails or ASP.net MVC guy and are located near Seattle, WA or Tokyo, Japan or don't mind me working mostly remotely, feel free to contact me.</p>

<li>core product development in ASP.NET</li>
<li>occasional consulting, mostly integrations to our app</li>
<li>servers and DBA tasks, Cisco ASA firewall</li>
<li>general tech support</li>
</ul>
</p>
